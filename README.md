# sms_spam_detector

In this challenege we attempted to create a model that allowed for software to answer the question
"Is the incoming message spam or not spam."

We utilized train_test_split in our training and further utilized TfidVectorizer and LinearSVC on the model.

Finally, we utilized an if / else statement for our output message, and created our interface using gr.Interface, allowing this to be web-accessible.
